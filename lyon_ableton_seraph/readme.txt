Hello,

the attached folder contains an Ableton project and the necessary sound files to play it. It's a collage of semi-rhythmic ambient loops and highly textured soundscapes that I feel fits into a modern dance performance. First of all, I hope you like the style of the music and it also goes with your idea of the project.
I included grouped tracks: One (white) is the base track; three colored groups (purple, orange, and green) for the pairwise connections while the white one could work as the climax sound when all the boxes are connected.

I recorded an arrangement as an example of how the sound could develop (example_arrangement.wav). It starts with the base track and around every 30secs-1min a new group is added or interchanged. The first climax part starts at arround 03:30 mins, the second (very short one) at 07:30 mins. You can use it as a reference to check if the project is playing correctly.

Some things to take care of when working with the project:

The grey 'base'-group is a bit disharmonic. I liked that it has this diffuse sound - it just can get a bit annoying when some more groups are being played. I would consider lowering its volume as soon as 1 (or two) other groups started playing. 

In general, check the volumes when the climax part is beeing played - i like the effect it has on top of all the other color groups, it can definetly get a bit loud and stressfull. Filtering the other groups or lowering (or moudulating) the volumes when the climax part starts might be a good idea.

I added filters on the group master tracks - a regular auto-filter and one automated where an LFO is modulating the frequency and the resonance. This could be used to make the piece interactive and to make the dancers control some sounds (i modulated it to simulate that effect while composing the piece). Filtering individual groups also help with making the sound a bit less messy. U could also modulate the volumes of the sub-tracks of the groups, that's why I sent you the whole arrangement. 

Another thing I would consider: even if I tried to make the single tracks as different as possible, I ended up with 5 tracks that have quite some similarities - it was too difficult in that short amount of time to create tracks, that all work together while sounding very diverse. To still create the effect of change in the sound when a new connection is being made, it could help to e.g. lower the volumes of the old tracks and increase the volume of the new one, or add some impact sound-fx to put an accent on the moment of a new connection between the boxes.

Let me know if you use my sounds, and if there are any questions regarding the Ableton project, etc. feel free to contact me. My e-mail is derserafin@gmail.com.
Ahh and please only use the sound files for the project since there are some sounds from older as well as future projects being used in the composition.

Wish you a lot of fun working for the performance & in Lyon. 
Best,

Serafin
